PIXEL POKEMON: Gotta Beat Em' All!

#### How to Play
Choose a team of 4 Pokemon to enter the battle and defeat your opponent to win the game and become “Trainer Supreme”.

Take turns to attack, one Pokemon at a time. If a Pokemon is hit by a Pokemon whose type is his weakness, the attack damage is doubled. However, if he is hit by a Pokemon he is resistant to, the damage is cut in half. Each Pokemon recovers 10 energy after each round and 20 HP after each battle.
